Address book management system is based on the concept to store personal or an organization addresses and view it. Adding new records, listing them, deleting them, and converting it into a HTML file to view in a browser. These are the basic functions which make up the main menu of the address book management system. The system is especially useful to get the address. Personal information such as name, phone number, address, email, and current location are asked while adding a record into the address book. These records can then be added, viewed, converted into a html file, and deleted.
